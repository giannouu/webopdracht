Hello there. My name is Meagan and I am majoring in both Computer Science and Information Science
at Utrecht University. I have many interests in the Computer Science department, from gameprogramming 
to computer hardware. After the bachelorprogram I'd like to specialize myself in Security. Also, I
don't like to share pictures of myself, so here is an image of the Pok√©mon <b>Chansey</b>!
