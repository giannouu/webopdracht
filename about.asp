<h1>About</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Webshop XL. This online webshop was created by students from Utrecht University
for the course <b>'Informatie-uitwisseling'</b>. In this course, we had to create a webshop for our own
research concerning Trust in e-commerce. With this webshop, we have been able to collect data from multiple
participants. This data will only be used for this research in this course.</p>
<p>Thus, this site itself and its content are only part of this teamproject from this course. This course
is done in the Information science curriculum at the university. Its sole purpose is purely educational
and there are no commercial interests involved whatsoever.</p>
<p>The materials are carefully checked before using it for this website, to make sure there is no copyright
violation. If inappropriate content is used accidentally still, please inform us and we will be happy
to remove it.</p>
